The XF-84 Raptor is the most advanced air superiority prototype that humanity has ever produced. You have trained rigorously to withstand the massive G-forces the Raptor's maneuverability produces while at the same time effectively engaging and destroying any opposition.

A vast alien fleet lurks at humanity's doorstep -- a surprise assault -- and you are humanity's first and only line of defense. You are flying solo, fighting massively superior numbers, in a fast-paced dog-fight to survive. Use your three powerful weapons and make the best of your ability to become invincible and perform special attacks while dodging shots and out-maneuvering enemies. Finity Flight includes 15 levels of increasing difficulty and is a completely free and open-source game.
